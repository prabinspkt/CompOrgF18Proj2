# CompOrgF18Proj2

## 2nd project/assignment for Computer Organization I

- This program written in MIPS takes up to 4 characters as user input.
- If the characters are valid in a base-36 number system, it prints out the valid unsigned decimal integer.
- If the input is empty, it prints "Input is empty.".
- If the input is more than 4 characters, it prints "Input is too long.".
- If any of the character in the input is invalid in base-36 number system, it prints out "Invalid base-36 number.".

## Constraints
- The program must process user input in loop.
- The program must NOT have subprograms.

*Tested using QtSpim.*
